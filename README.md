COSCO: A Sharpness-Aware Training Framework for Few-shot Multivariate Time Series Classification

Abstract:
Time series classification is an important task with widespread applications in many different domains. Recently, deep neural networks have achieved state-of-the-art performance in time series classification, but often require large datasets and expert-labeled supervision for effective model training. In data scarcity situations, deep learning models often experience a significant decline. In this paper, we propose a training framework named COSCO to mitigate the decline in performance from a loss function and optimization perspective for the few-shot multivariate time series classification problem, where only a few samples are available. Particularly, we propose to apply a prototypical loss function and the sharpness-aware minimization (SAM) technique to enhance the generalization ability for deep learning classifier in few-shot multivariate time series classification problem. Such optimization techniques can be arbitrarily used in any deep learning models. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method with ResNet backbone on few-shot benchmark datasets formed by UCR classification data.
